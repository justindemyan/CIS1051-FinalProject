# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Virtual BlackJack 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Blackjack game that includes going against the dealer and being able to split or double down on a hand. Possibly include a balance of money to bet.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a code in Python Idle that will allow a user to play the game of Blackjack. The Player will be dealt 2 cards while the dealer is dealt 2 cards (one being face down). The player will have the decision to get dealt another card, split if they have 2 of the same cards, double down a bet and get 1 more card worth twice of what they bet, or hold and keep what they have. The player is against the dealer so the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting). Each card is worth its number value, face cards are worth 10, and aces are worth 1 or 11. The player's goal is to beat the dealer's number or have the dealer bust to win their bet. I will use functions along with for loops, while, if, else, and elif statements to execute this code.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will at minimum accomplish a standard BlackJack game that has an individual being dealt 2 cards and have the option to hit or stay on their hand, while trying to get as close as possible to 21. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my project will be for it to include extra features such as playing against a dealer and being able to split or double down on a hand.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of this project will be to include all of the features listed above and also a way of having a balance of money that can be gambled on each hand with a goal of winning the game by getting to 1000$, being able to walk away with money, or going broke and losing.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is to start thinking about each aspect of the rules and gameplay and how to make that happen within my code. I believe that I have the necessary skills to execute this project. I will have to spend time refreshing and sharpening my skills involving functions, for and while loops, and if/else/elif statements. It will also help me to look at the official rules of BlackJack even though I know it well, it would help to make my project as exact as possible.
