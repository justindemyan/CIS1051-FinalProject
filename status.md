Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a code that deals 2 cards to a player and the dealer and I am currently refining it.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to work on adding a money balance to use for betting on each hand that is dealt.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am having trouble figuring out how to incorporate the ability to double down or split the cards once they are dealt. I can't find a way to add these features into my code without getting syntax errors or messing up my code, but I am going to keep trying.
