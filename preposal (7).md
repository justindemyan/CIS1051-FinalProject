# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My idea is to create a blackjack game but not a simple version. I want to include the options to double down or split the two cards in the game and potentially have a certain amount of money that one starts with and can have the option to "walk away" or keep playing and maybe have an objective. For example, if one starts with 100$ the goal is to reach 500$ without going broke.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not at the moment.
